## envaws

Launch a subprocess with environment variables using data from AWS S3 or SQS
queues.

Envaws provides a convenient way to launch a subprocess with environment 
variables populated from AWS services S3 and SQS. The tool is inspired by 
envconsul.

Envaws supports [12-factor applications](https://12factor.net/) which get their 
configuration via the environment. Environment variables are dynamically 
populated from S3 or SQS, but the application is unaware; applications just read 
environment variables. This enables extreme flexibility and portability for 
applications across systems.
